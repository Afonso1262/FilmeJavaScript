        <h2>Ben 10: Destroy All Aliens</h2>

        <p>Ten-year-old Ben Tennyson is finally back from his summer vacation... and his life is a mess! Humiliated by
            his teacher, grounded by his parents, and cursed with a malfunctioning Omnitrix that's vaporizing his
            homework, Ben seizes an opportunity to "get away from it all" by exploring the galaxy with his alien buddy
            Tetrax. However, he quickly finds himself crashing back to Earth in alien form and unable to turn human
            again! To make matters worse, Ben soon encounters a deadly Mechamorph Warrior - just like Ben's Upgrade
            alien, but armed with explosive high-tech armor and a single-minded goal to destroy all aliens! As Grandpa
            Max, Gwen and Tetrax race to track him down, Ben's battle with the Mechamorph Warrior takes them to the
            Omniverse - a strange world that exists within the Omnitrix itself - and a deadly battle with an evil
            version of Ben's most powerful alien of all: the hundred-foot-tall Way Big! But little does Ben know that
            neither the Mechamorph Warrior nor the Evil Way Big are exactly what they seem!</p>

            brave enough, smart enough and tough enough to fight back - Ben Tennyson! But when Ben teams up with an
            outsider, he breaks rank with Gwen, Kevin, and Max and risks losing against the toughest enemy he has ever
            faced. <br>

            The stakes are high and the action is intense as Ben fights to protect our planet from the Alien
            Swarm!</p>
